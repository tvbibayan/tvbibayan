## I architect digital experiences where technical rigor meets aesthetic precision. As a UI/UX Developer, I specialize in the convergence of design and engineering. Leveraging the structural power of Python and TypeScript, I craft robust ecosystems, while utilizing Three.js to redefine the user journey through immersive, spatial web environments. My work is dedicated to the belief that code should not just function; it should feel.
